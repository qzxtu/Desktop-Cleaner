[assembly: AssemblyDescription("This program is a desktop file organizer. It sorts files and folders on the user’s desktop into specific subfolders based on their file type or other criteria. The program reads a configuration file (config.json) to determine which file extensions belong to which categories (e.g., images, audio, videos, etc.). If the configuration file does not exist, the program creates a default one. The program also logs its actions to a log file (log.txt) for troubleshooting purposes.")]
